Copper Tools
===========

An open-source WIP Minecraft mod that adds a bunch of metal tools.
The code is an overcomplicated mess. Ye be warned.

Curse: http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/226508-coppertools

Permissions to distribute this build will be obtained later on, when I feel I have done what I need to do.
